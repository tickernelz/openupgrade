pos_hr       / pos.config               / employee_ids (many2many)      : DEL relation: hr.employee
# DONE: pre-migration: rename table from hr_employee_pos_config_rel to pos_hr_basic_employee_hr_employee
# Fill basic_employee_ids with records from employee_ids to preserve the old behavior.
# The new field advanced_employee_ids is used for employees who do not have a user_id but can be considered managers.
# However, this feature must be set manually by the user if necessary,
