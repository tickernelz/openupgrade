# DONE: post-migration: create dynamic x_plan_id column using '_sync_plan_column' method in analytic.plan, pr: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/139225

analytic     / account.analytic.plan    / default_applicability (selection): not stored anymore
# DONE: post-migration: create ir.property if default_applicability != 'optional'
