pos_sale     / crm.team                 / dashboard_graph_group_pos (selection): DEL selection_keys: ['day', 'month', 'pos', 'user', 'week']
# NOTHING TO DO: graph configuration fields have been removed

pos_sale     / crm.team                 / team_type (False)             : DEL selection_keys: ['pos', 'sales', 'website'], mode: modify
# NOTHING TO DO: removed field, every team should be able to handle a POS or a website for example

pos_sale     / pos.order                / crm_team_id (many2one)        : NEW relation: crm.team
# DONE: post-migration: Map to config team relation. Before that relation was the one used to group in the sales report.

pos_sale     / pos.order                / currency_rate (float)         : module is now 'point_of_sale' ('pos_sale')
# NOTHING TO DO: Will be handled by ORM on module update

---XML records in module 'pos_sale'---
NEW crm.team: sales_team.pos_sales_team (noupdate)
DEL ir.ui.view: pos_sale.crm_team_view_form_inherit_pos_sale
# NOTHING TO DO

DEL crm.team: pos_sale.pos_sales_team [renamed to sales_team module] (noupdate)
# NOTHING TO DO: renamed xmlids in sales_team

DEL pos.config: point_of_sale.pos_config_main (noupdate)
# NOTHING TO DO: point_of_sale.pos_config_main still exists in module
    point_of_sale. Now the module pos_sale does not add a value for
    crm_team_id in the xml file, it only rely on the default value
    defined with a function in the model pos.config. The value set in
    previous version should no be modified.
